Upon his entry, I just saw his bright white head glide across, in b-line formation, towards the end of the building. There he stood, next to a stranger’s vacant black SUV. He began scouting around, making sure the  coast was clear as if he was going to attempt and open the door. To say the least, it was shocking to see him in pursuit. Perhaps, in his mind, his jacket cloaked his every move with the sight of camouflage to the sound of stealth. But, on the contrary…. Although, no sun could be seen in the sky, a spotlight pierced straight through onto this man in blue.\n\nWhile observing my father, watching him observe the crowd, I was on a call with my brother discussing our dad’s worsening habits while trying to capture this whole incident by phone. Unfortunately, a different oversized SUV pulled into the lot and totally obstructed my view."
